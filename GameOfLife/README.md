Controlls:
"+" increases update rate 
"-" decreases update rate
"'space'" pauses/unpauses the game (all other controlls work both while paused and unpaused)
"left click" causes the selected cell to change state (from dead to alive or alive to dead)
"shif + left click" spawns a 4-3 sideways oval (with it's left "eye" on the selected cell)
"right click" spawns a 9-9 explosion pattern
"middle click" spawns the acorn
"r" resets the are to all dead cells
"shift + r" resets the area and spawns a new 15% alive cell area

Hexbased game of life:
"+" "-" "space" "r" "shift + r" kontroller fungerar på hexgrid också. Mus kontroller är avstängda.
"r" fungerar inte alltid perfekt i hex.
